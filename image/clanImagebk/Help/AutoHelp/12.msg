Priston Tale provides Clan System. You can join a clan
regardless of the character¡¯s level. 
However, your level should be 40 or higher to form a clan. 
Once you become a member of a clan 
you will find the symbol of the clan attached
in front of the name of your character 
and you can chat with your clan members 
and use Union Core to move freely to your clan members.
