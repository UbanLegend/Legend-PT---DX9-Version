A few days ago, the young man, Michelle 
of Nevisco town who¡¯s exploring the 
Cursed Temple lost his life by Typhoon.

The Nevisco dwellers intend to give a big
prize to anyone who hunts Typhoons.

The Nevisco dwellers under a curse of being
monsters at nights delegated a power to me
to give the prize. 

If you hunt 10 Typhoon, I¡¯ll give you a big
prize on behalf of the Nevisco.

Please revenge of the Nevisco.
