Hello. I really need your help.

It is very hard to manufacture C-stone
from specimens that are brought by 
Royal Mages. The problem is we have many broken 
pieces from unsuccessful manufacturing.

Even though these are broken pieces of C-stone,
they still retain evil power. These can become
objects of evil. These need to be thrown away before
this happens. 

Help me to discard these broken pieces. 
This is very urgent!!!
