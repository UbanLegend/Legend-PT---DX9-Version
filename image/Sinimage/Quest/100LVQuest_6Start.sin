Wow! Im very pleased with your battle against
Fury. You've fought well and can call yourself
a "Hero". This time i'll summon a balanced Fury.

I'll try to summon Fury using all my willpower.
This Fury will have similar power that i've 
fought long time ago. So put your best on this 
battle.

Once you moved to the training stage, you can't 
use core to come out. So you better prepare 
for death in this battle.

I'll move you to the training stage if you are ready.
