"The legend of Nine, Tale amulet"

I have been finding a pair of stolen necklaces 
for 10 years. But I am so tired.

However, the necklaces are in somewhere.
I can feel it.

I'd like to give up, but I'am still waiting him.
By the way, you look strong.
If you find the necklaces for me,
I will give items which were collected before.

Please.

Let's hunt monsters,
They will drop Nine, Tail randomly, and 
bring them to Preia.
