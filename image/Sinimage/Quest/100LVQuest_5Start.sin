On the 2nd quest you've fought with Fury that has 
great defense.

I was very pleased with the battle between the 
Fury and you. Well on your next quest you will 
also need to fight Fury that I will summon.
But this time, i've increase its attack power.
This Fury will attack with enormous power, so 
be careful!

Once you moved to the training stage, you can't
use core to come out. So you better be prepare 
for death in this battle.

I'll move you to the training stage if you are 
ready.
