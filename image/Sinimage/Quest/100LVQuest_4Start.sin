Recently we received the report from our patrol
team on Eura Village.

A bunch of monsters comes in flocks with
unexpected speed. However we cannot defend from 
those monsters with our patrol team in Eura Village.
It'll be great if you go there and help them.

Those monsters are from Valley of Gallubia. I 
will count this action as 3rd quest if you
go to Valley of Gallubia and hunt 100 monsters.
Hurry! We need your help!!
