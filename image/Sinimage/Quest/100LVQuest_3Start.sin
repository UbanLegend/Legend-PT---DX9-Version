I'll give you 2nd quest.
You need to fight Fury that I will summon.

Too bad, it's not the Fury that is sealed in Cursed 
Temple. It just an illusion made by my willpower.
However it is more powerful and defensive than
any other normal monsters so you better look sharp! 

Once you moved to the training stage, you can't use 
core to come out. So you better be prepare for death
to fight in this battle.

I'll move you to the training stage if you are ready.
