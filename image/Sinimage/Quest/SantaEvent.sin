Hello!
I¡¯m Rudolf who came to continent of Priston 
on behalf of Santa Claus.
I¡¯m gathering lost 7 materials of Santa costume 
for Santa¡¯s errand.  

When Christmas season is coming, 
Snowman takes away all materials of Santa costume. 
7 materials are Rudolf horn, Muffler, Gold bell, 
Cotton, Button, Gift bag, and Green cloth.

If you bring each one of 7 materials, 
I give you a thankful gift.
I will only stay until Dec 30th. 
Please, bring materials to me before I leave.
