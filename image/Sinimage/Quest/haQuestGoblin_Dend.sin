Actually Goblins are not intelligent enough to 
move in formation.
However with unknown reason, They are moving in 
formation and marching towards the town gate.
We need to organize our militia and defend our 
town quickly.

First I'll give you a ring and amulet to defeat 
the Goblins.

When you equip your ring and amulet, they will 
increase your life, stamina and mana.
Anyway I have to report this message to our Knight 
leader. May the bless of Awell be with you...
