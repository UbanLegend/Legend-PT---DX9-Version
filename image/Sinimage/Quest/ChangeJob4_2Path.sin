Second quest is similar with First quest.
You hunt monsters on time. You don't have time
to buy potion(s) so you have to request from 
your clan or party members to save time. 
Please save your time to hunt monsters. Come 
back to me again after finishing the hunt.

Don't waste your time. Hurry Up! and finish 
your hunt.
