You haven't finished discarding the pieces of C-stones?
You would do better to be well prepared before
evil things arrive.

There are total of 7 pieces to be discarded.
You are not the only one helping me. However, 
I'm worried because there are so many left.

You can activate it if you bring them to the north
of a special place at Lost Temple.
