Ah! You must be the one the master sent.
It is so hard to get 'Royal Jelly' these days.
I heard that you can make 'Royal Jelly' by 
aging 9 drops of honey from the beehive with 
the glass bottle. If you bring me that, I will 
tell magic master that you have completed the 
rank-up quest.
 
[Quest Mission]

  Acquire 9 drops of honey from the 'Beedog'. 
  Then age to make 'Royal Jelly' and take it 
  to 'Molly the Granny'
