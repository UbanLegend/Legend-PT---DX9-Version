You are already over 39 levels and become a 
dignified combatant. So you can't do the quests 
for beginners anymore. You've grew out of 
beginner, how do you feel? Are you happy? I was 
also very proud of you each time you grew up. 
Please go to the wide world and train more 
in order to arrest Igolanos and its cohorts.

From now, you can't do the quests for beginners. 
If you are under the quest for beginners, 
it will be stopped.

May the spirit of Awell and Mardanos be with you.
