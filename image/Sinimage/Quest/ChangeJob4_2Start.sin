You have done the hunt on time...I haven't 
imagined you finish the quest on time. However,
you have just finished one of three quests.

Second quest is similar with First quest. Also,
you hunt monsters on time but these monsters 
are stronger than monsters of first quest. 
Please hunt the monsters quickly. Maybe, you 
don't have time to buy Potion(s).

Go ahead.

[Quest Subject]

You hunt selected monsters on time for Skill 
master.
