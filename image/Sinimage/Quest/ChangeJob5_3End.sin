As I expected, your ability is far greater than
mine. You have the right to try the 4th 
rank up test, so go to Elder Hosean at 
Rallway of Chaos. He is supervising the test.
If you bring 3 moon stones to him, you have
a right to take the test.

If you go to the northwest at Railway of Chaos,
you will meet Elder Hosean. There are many 
powerful  monsters, so be careful. 

It's your turn now. Comeback after passing
the test.
