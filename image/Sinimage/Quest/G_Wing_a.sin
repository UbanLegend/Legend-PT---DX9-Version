Oh, you have the silver wing.  Don't you need my 
gold wing? Obvioulsy, this is better than yours.

I assume you are here to look for a better one since 
you know your silver wing is not strong enough.

If so, bring me a silver wing, decoy crystal, bargon 
crystal, and 10000 gold.
Then I will trade with my gold wing.

What do you think?  Wanna try?
