You know what? A group of Bargons attacked us on our
way of shopping for some HP potions to Nevisko.
We don't know what to do about this 'cause it never
happened before. Will we get attacked again?

By the way, you look very strong. Would you get rid 
of 20 Bargons from Forgotten Land for us?

If you do, I promise I will give you a reward that 
is very helpful for you.

Thank you. ^-^
