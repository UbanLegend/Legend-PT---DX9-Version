Are you ready? I will explain how to
install C-stones.

You need to install a total of 8 C-stones.
You can install a C-stone at 
Acacia Grove, Land of Dusk, Castle of the 
Lost, Battlefield the Ancient, Heart of Perum, 
Greedy Lake, Frozen sanctuary, and Lost Temple.

A C-Stone is activated in the middle of the field
between 2 PM and 12 midnight. Don't forget
to follow rules of installation. Come back
to me after you've completed the installation.
