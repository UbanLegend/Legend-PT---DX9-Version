Welcome back. We finally finished installing C-stone
at Royal Mage. However, the effective range 
of this C-stone is not far enough, so it needs to 
be installed in many places acroos the continent. 
Kingdom of Temskron and Morion are united in
hunting monsters, and give the order to install
C-stones.

One more time, we need your help. You can 
leave anytime when you are ready for this.
Since you have to travel all over the
continent, it will take a long time.
Ask me again, when you are ready.
