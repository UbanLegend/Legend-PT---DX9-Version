I presume you are stronger and physically more 
powerful than I am.
You have passed all Job quest requirements and
finally, you can learn 4 new skills. These 4 
kinds of skills don¡¯t have to be trained. 
Additionally, these skills are more superior 
to the ones you have learned earlier.
 
But do not conceit.
As your skills are more powerful, therefore 
they need more time for recharging.
While you are recharging, your situation can 
get critical.
