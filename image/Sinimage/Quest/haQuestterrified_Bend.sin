You did great at hunting, Can you feel that 
you're going to be a Warrior? As a reward for 
hunting successfully, I'll give the armlet as 
a reward.



Armlet has the space for storing potion so that 
you can use it while you are in battle.
At the same time, it raises some defense ability 
so you have a lower fatality rate.
Fortunately, you got the long armlet which is 
specialized armlet and makes defensive health 
stronger.

Now, have the other adventure.
