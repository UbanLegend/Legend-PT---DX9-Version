The ruined city, Navisko is located in the center
of desert and is on the way to dungeons and temples.
A small number of civilians are now left 
and make their living by running shops and stores.
Recently SOD amphitheater has been founded to test
warriors' ablity and skills and thus Navisko becomes
rather happening place. 

However, civilians of Navisko are spellbound by
evil spirit and turn into monsters every night.
It becomes condemned city at night.
