The performance of an item can be upgraded by visiting the
aging master in Pillai with some sheltoms and money. An item
can be aged 10 times and each successful aging gives the
item a distinctive splendor. However, the chance of failure
becomes higher after each aging, with a risk of losing
sheltoms, money, and even the item itself.
